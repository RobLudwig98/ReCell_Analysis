Project Overview
Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for ReCell, a company in the used and refurbished device market. The analysis aims to use machine learning to predict the prices of used devices and identify key factors that influence these prices. This will help ReCell optimize its pricing strategy to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demands.
Objectives

    Analyze the provided dataset and understand the factors influencing the prices of used and refurbished devices.
    Develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the prices of used devices based on various attributes.
    Provide actionable insights and recommendations to enhance ReCell's pricing, inventory management, and marketing strategies.

Project Description

This project involves building a linear regression model to predict the normalized used price of devices based on their attributes. Key activities include:

    Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, central tendencies, and outlier impacts.
    Preprocessing the data by handling missing values, checking for outliers, and creating new features through feature engineering.
    Developing and evaluating a linear regression model to predict device prices.
    Providing recommendations for dynamic pricing, inventory management, and marketing strategies.

Metrics Evaluated

    Normalized Used Price: The price of the used device after adjusting for various factors.
    Device Attributes: Features such as brand name, operating system (OS), screen size, 4G/5G capability, camera resolutions (main and selfie cameras), internal memory, RAM, battery capacity, weight, release year, and days used.

Evaluations Conducted

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of device attributes and their impact on normalized used prices.
    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, checking for and treating outliers, and creating new features through feature engineering.
    Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict normalized used prices.
    Model Performance Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared.
    Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most important features influencing the normalized used prices.

Key Findings

    Price Sensitivity: Significant correlation between device features (e.g., camera resolution, battery capacity, connectivity options) and pricing.
    Market Trends: High demand for 4G and emerging 5G devices; newer devices retain value longer.
    Consumer Preferences: Preference for devices with higher RAM, internal memory, large screens, and high-resolution cameras.

Recommendations

    Dynamic Pricing Model Implementation: Integrate the predictive pricing model to update prices based on real-time data and market fluctuations.
    Inventory Management: Align inventory acquisition with consumer preferences for specifications like battery life, camera quality, and connectivity.
    Marketing and Sales Strategies: Develop targeted marketing campaigns highlighting premium features of high-demand devices and offer promotional pricing for older models.
    Sustainability Focus: Emphasize the environmental benefits of purchasing refurbished devices and offer warranties to increase consumer trust.
